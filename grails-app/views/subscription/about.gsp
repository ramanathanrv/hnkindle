		<h3>What's this all about?</h3>
		<p>
			There are few things in the world that are worth mentioning!
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> is a great way to get amazing information</li>
				<li>Reading on kindle is fantastic</li>
			</ul>
			HNKindle is a simple application that is trying to tie together these to ensure that information reaches you in the most desired format as and when available.

		<p>Note: Only those articles that make it to Top 10 will be delivered. Other salient points
			<ul>
				<li>Since hacker news is just a collection of links, some of the entries might not have enough content to be qualified as an article. In those cases, the document might be empty.</li>
				<li>I must acknowledge the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/boilerpipe/">BoilerPipe</a> project without which this application would not have existed.</li>
				<li>Readability.com is in an enviable position. Hopefully they can commercialize this idea in a big way</li>
			</ul>
