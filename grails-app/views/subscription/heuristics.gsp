		The entries in Hacker News are not arbitrarily chosen. They undergo some set of rules to be able to make it a mailable entry.

		<p><h3>Heuristic Used</h3>
		If any of the conditions are met, then an entry will qualify to be sent.
		<ul>
			<li>It should have a score &gt;100</li>
			<li>It should have received more than 50 comments</li>
			<li>It has one of the important keywords (from a simple list) and must be in the Top 10</li>
		</ul>			
		</p>
		<p><h3>HS#1 <span class="small grey">(Expired)</span></h3>
		If any of the conditions are met, then an entry will qualify to be sent.
		<ul>
			<li>It should be in the Top 10 entries</li>
		</ul>
		<strong>Inference</strong><br>
		There was so much movement in the Hacker News listing that this strategy quicly lead to sending so many mails in a day. Some customers even referred to it as Spam, very kindly. Besides, not all the articles were also of great quality. A lot of articles would soon get off the front page itself. These inferences lead to the development of HS#2 which is presently active.
